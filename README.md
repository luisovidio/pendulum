# PENDULUM
Double Pendulum simulation on C with OpenGL

**This program needs OpenGL to compile. Set up your linking settings in your IDE.**

###Variables that could be changed:
**In function Inicializa():**
- L1 -> Lenght of the first pendulum (m)
- L2 -> Lenght of the second pendulum (m)
- Teta1 -> Initial angle of the first pendulum (rad)
- Teta2 -> Initial angle of the sencond pendulum (rad)
- M1 -> Mass of the first pendulum (Kg)
- M2 -> Mass of the second pendulum (Kg)
- Omega1 -> Initial angular acceleration of the first pendulum (rad/s²)
- Omega2 -> Initial angular acceleration of the second pendulum (rad/s²)
- G -> gravity (m/s²)
- h -> Runge-Kutta variation

**Any place of the code:**
- The values of any glColor3f(R,G,B) can be changed (values range 0.0f - 1.0f)
